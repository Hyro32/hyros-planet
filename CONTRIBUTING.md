When contributing to the repository you have the possibility to directly edit the files from the Github website or by cloning the project on your local machine. In the case of a fork you can make changes in your clone project without the need to send the changes to the main repository.

> **Note**
> When creating a PR, a short guide on how to fill in the necessary information will appear.

Useful prefixes for your PR title:

- For internationalization requests: `i18n(<locale>)`
- For not finished job: `WIP` (Work In Progress)

## Sync the repository

When working with a `fork` of the repository you need to keep in mind updating the repo to the latest changes. This is a little guide about how to sync and update you fork:

#### Manually via Github UI

1. Navigate to your fork on Github.
2. Click <kbd>Sync fork</kbd> and then <kbd>Update branch</kbd>

#### Manually from the command line

In the terminal on your computer:

1. Make sure youâ€™re on the main branch: `git checkout main`
2. Fetch and merge updates: `git pull upstream main`
3. Push the updates back to your fork on GitHub: `git push origin main`
